# GameDay

This is a NWjs application for managing a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)
Adventurer's League (AL) game day.

This application helps organize AL play by importing signup CSVs from
Google Forms that contain player names and DCI numbers and then
exporting them as XML that Wizards Event Reporter can understand.
